# Application Overview

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, provided with the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course material. What I added to this application was a test suite, written using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

# How to run the application

Running the application is simple - just download the repository and open index.html in your favorite browser. Click on a feed that you'd like to see, and it will show up. You can click on the menu button in the top left corner of the page to show more feed category options.

# The Test suite

When you open the application, you will see at the bottom the result of several tests (written using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)) on the application. These tests are written in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js and test the functionality of the application.
